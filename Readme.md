\# 🍽️ AR Food Menu with 3D, Cart \& Order ETA



This project is a \*\*web-based interactive food menu\*\* designed for restaurants.

Customers can view Indian food items, see a \*\*3D rotating model\*\*, add items to cart,

place an order, and see an \*\*estimated preparation time\*\*.



This is an MVP (proof of concept) built for demo, validation, and further scaling

into AR menus and restaurant ordering systems.
